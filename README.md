Property Privately API
======================

Property Privately is a self serve, private property sales website. Users will be able to register, list their property(s) or view other users properties. The idea behind it is to cut out the estate agent and save money when selling or letting a property.

So far, the only thing set in stone is the use of Symfony2 to write develop an API for the front-end to interact with.
