# TODO List

* Make user specific queries actually user specific
* Make resources give sensible responses for security bundle
* Application self link is wrong
    - Related, all links to applications are wrong, there needs to be:
    - /applications/<app id>
    - Which doesn't show the token still!
* Include more sensible embedded resources (like in the tokens of application)
* See if other templated links may be necessary
* Create new resource map.
* Check over all GET controllers, and assemblers to see if there is anything unecessary in them.

* Implement DELETE actions
* Implement POST actions
* Implement PATCH actions
* Implement PUT actions (if any)
